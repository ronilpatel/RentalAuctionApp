The Online Rental Auction System serves as a platform where real estate properties are rented. It helps both the Tenants as well as Landlords.

Tentants:
1. Find rentals at unknown places.
2. Searching for rental within comfort of your home.
3. Analyze multiple rentals before making actual decision.
4. Convey the landlord about the rent which the tenant can afford through the bids.
5. Rent payment made easy through Token based payment.
6. Monthly Rent receipts are mailed after the payment of the rent.

Landlord:
1. Can choose from multiple tenants who offers the maximum bid.
2. Monthly Rent collection through organised Toke based payment system.
3. No worries anymore about the Rentals after the tenant has left, with new tenants making advanced bids.

For Tenants, it helps them to find relevant & appropriate Rented properties-apartments, condomium, bunglows etc. On the other end for Landlord, it helps them to 
fix an exhaustive deal i.e. maximum return.

The transparent Rental auction provides opportunity in which all the interested tenants can evaluate the bids from the competitors to make their offers. The Open assessment 
results in a fair market price that benifits both the landlords & the tenants.
It provides a clear communication between tenants & landlords. Interested tenants can make informed decisions on basis of demands & highest offers which leads to 
stress-free negotiations. It helps the tenants to make custom offers according to their affordability. This mutuality helps both to fix the deal as soon as possilbe.
